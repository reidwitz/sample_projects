# Naive Bayes Algorithm

In this project, we're using the Naive Bayes Algorithm to design a spam filter for SMS messages using 5,572 messages that have been classified as "spam"
or as "ham". The project begins with a relatively unambitious target of 80% accuracy, but in fact achieves  98.7% accuracy in our test subset!
