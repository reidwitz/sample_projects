# K-Nearest Neighbors

In this project, we examine the efficacy of different features and build a model to predict the sale price of a car. We vary the number of features used
and iterate over k to find the optimal model.

We start by running K-nearest neighbors on one variable at a time, then switch to a multivariate model.
